With WordPress, you have more than likely used the functionality to create pages to display your content, be it an About Us section, Contact page, or even a full portfolio. But where are these pages actually stored? In this section, we take a look at how WordPress does some of its magic with pages behind the scenes.

## How WordPress Stores Pages

Unlike static HTML sites, WordPress is a database-driven application. Instead of writing and saving pages directly to files on your server, WordPress stores all of your page data within its MySQL database.

**Database Table for Pages**
WordPress stores your page content in the wp\_posts table of its database. Despite the confusing name, this table handles both posts and pages. Here's how this works:

**Post Type Identifier:**
Pages are designated as page in the post\_type column of the wp\_posts table. This differentiates them from posts - designated as post - or other custom content types.

**Page Metadata:**
If you have additional data about your pages - custom fields or page templates, for example - it is stored in the wp\_postmeta table.

**Revisions:**
Every time you save a page, WordPress creates a revision. These are stored in the wp\_posts table, too. The post\_type is set to revision.

**Where does the Page Content Go?**
While content is held in the database, it is served dynamically by PHP and theme template. For instance:

The page.php file in your active theme is what controls how the pages are rendered. If no such specific template exists, WordPress uses its default template hierarchy to display the page.

**Other Page Components**
**Media Files:**
If your pages have images or videos, the media files themselves are housed in the /wp-content/uploads/ folder, but that information is not stored in the database. Instead the URLs for those files are added to the wp\_posts table with post\_type of attachment.

**Menus and Navigation:**
If your pages are part of a menu, the menu structure is stored in the wp\_terms and related tables.

## Why Does WordPress Use This Structure?

Store pages in a database offers several advantages in that:

**Dynamic Updates**: This allows each and every change made to a page to be updated instantly without having to change any static files.
**Scalability**: WordPress supports literally thousands of pages without burdening the server.
**Flexibility**: All custom post types, taxonomies, and plugins can have nice integration into the database-driven architecture.

## How to View WordPress Pages in the Database

If you want to see or manage your WordPress pages directly in the database, then follow these steps:

1.  Open your hosting provider's cPanel and open the database management tool-like phpMyAdmin.

2.  Click wp\_posts table.

3.  Filter the results by setting the post\_type to page.

*Pro Tip: Always back up your database before making any changes.*

**Conclusion**
Knowing where WordPress pages are stored will help you troubleshoot a problem, [customize your site](https://cozythemes.com/blog/customizable-wordpress-theme/), or simply appreciate how WordPress works. And the database-driven approach does mean flexibility, scalability, and ease of management, which makes WordPress a leader among websites of all genres.
