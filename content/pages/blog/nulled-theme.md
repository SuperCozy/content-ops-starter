When building a website on WordPress, the wordpress theme used can make all the difference in the overall look, functionality, and security of your online presence. As attractive as it may sound to get a [premium-quality WordPress theme](https://cozythemes.com/) for free, using a nulled theme can come with a host of risks and drawbacks that far outweigh any potential cost savings.

## What are Nulled WordPress Themes?

Nulled WordPress themes are hacked, premium WordPress themes that have had their licensing restrictions removed and are distributed for free download. Most of them are obtained through illegal means, such as hacking or unauthorized distribution, and are then distributed on shady websites or forums.

## The Risks of Using Nulled WordPress Themes

**1. Security Vulnerabilities**: Among the main risks of using nulled WordPress themes is the risk of security vulnerabilities. Bad actors are capable of embedding malware, backdoors, and other malicious code into these modified themes, which may compromise your website and put your users' data in jeopardy. Cybercriminals use these kinds of vulnerabilities to break into your site, steal sensitive information, or use your website for nefarious reasons like malware distribution or spam campaigns.

**2. No Support or Updates**: If you use a genuine, licensed WordPress theme, you typically get the author's support channels open for help and frequent updates to fix security issues or add new functionality. You won't be entitled to those when you use a nulled theme, which may leave your website open to potential problems and exploits.

**3. Legal Consequences**: Using a nulled WordPress theme is considered copyright infringement, and you may face legal action against you. If the original developer of the theme finds out that you're using their work without a valid license, they may take you to court, which may lead to fines, penalties, or even the suspension of your website.

**4. Compatibility Issues**: The Nulled theme may not work perfectly with the latest version of WordPress and other plugins/extensions integrated into your website. This can be very dangerous and can break up your website, with a potential security risk in such a situation.

**5. Reputational Damage**: If your website is found using a nulled theme, it can result in serious damage to your prestige and credibility, especially when operating a professional, commercial, or high-profile website.

## Choosing Legitimate WordPress Themes

Instead of risking using a nulled WordPress theme, it is always better to opt for licensed, legitimate themes from reputable sources. If you choose a legitimate theme, then you can enjoy a host of benefits, including:

**Security and Reliability**: The code of legitimate themes is vigorously tested and checked for security to ensure your website is safe against all known vulnerabilities and threats.

**Reliable Support and Updates**: You will have access to the support channels of the developer and regular updates to keep your website secure and updated.

**Compliance with WordPress Guidelines**: Genuine themes follow the guidelines and best practices laid down by WordPress, which means your website will be well-structured and optimized for performance and user experience.

**Reputation and Credibility**: Using a legitimate, licensed WordPress theme can help you build trust and credibility with your audience, which is crucial to the success of your website.

You can find high-quality, legitimate WordPress themes at reputable marketplaces. By choosing a legitimate theme, you ensure that your website will be long-term successful and secure.

In the end, the risks associated with using nulled WordPress themes outweigh any cost savings by a landslide. Legitimate, licensed themes offer security for your website, reliable support and updates, and protection of your reputation and credibility as a professional website owner.
